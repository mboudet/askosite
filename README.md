# askosite

Basic website linked to Askomics, aiming to provide an 'entity' catalogue

* Get abstraction from Askomics
* Build form a selected entity
* Send query to Asko and get results (how to paginate? Change the endpoint?)

* Advanced query send directly to Askomics?

TODO:

* Better UI
* Management of entity URI
